• Root cause: MOS / RRF aborts if a G2 or G3 command is generated without I, J, K, or R parameters
• Observed failure: CAM + post intermittently produced bare arc commands (e.g. G3 X… Z… F…)
• Fix approach: eliminate all native arc output from the post processor
• Change made: force linearization of every circular move
• Modified functions:
– onCircular() → always linearize
– outputArcCommand() → always linearize
– outputArcRadiusCommand() → always linearize
– outputFullCircleCommand() → always linearize
• Resulting G-code:
– Only G0 / G1 commands
– No G2 / G3 present
• Effect on MOS:
– Error G2/G3: no I J K or R parameter cannot occur
– Job runs reliably
• Side effect: slightly larger G-code file (expected, harmless)
